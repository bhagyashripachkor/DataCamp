Q1:-
Fill in the code based on the instructions in the code comments to complete the inner join. Note how many records are in the result of the join in the query result tab.

Solution:-
-- Select the city name (with alias), the country code,
-- the country name (with alias), the region,
-- and the city proper population
SELECT c1.name AS city, code, c2.name AS country,
       region, city_proper_pop
-- From left table (with alias)
FROM cities AS c1
  -- Join to right table (with alias)
  INNER JOIN countries AS c2
    -- Match on country code
    ON c1.country_code = c2.code
-- Order by descending country code
ORDER BY code desc;

Q2:-
Change the code to perform a LEFT JOIN instead of an INNER JOIN. After executing this query, note how many records the query result contains.

Solution:-
SELECT c1.name AS city, code, c2.name AS country,
       region, city_proper_pop
FROM cities AS c1
  -- 1. Join right table (with alias)
  left JOIN countries AS c2
    -- 2. Match on country code
    ON c1.country_code = c2.code
-- 3. Order by descending country code
ORDER BY code DESC;

Q3:-
Perform an inner join. Alias the name of the country field as country and the name of the language field as language.
