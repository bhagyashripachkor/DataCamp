Q1:-
Create a for loop to loop over flash and print the values in the list. Use person as the loop variable.
Create an iterator for the list flash and assign the result to superspeed.
Print each of the items from superspeed using next() 4 times.

Solution:-
# Create a list of strings: flash
flash = ['jay garrick', 'barry allen', 'wally west', 'bart allen']

# Print each list item in flash using a for loop
for person in flash:
    print(person)


# Create an iterator for flash: superspeed
superspeed = iter('flash')

# Print each item from the iterator
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))
print(next(superspeed))

Q2:-

Create an iterator object small_value over range(3) using the function iter().
Using a for loop, iterate over range(3), printing the value for every iteration. Use num as the loop variable.
Create an iterator object googol over range(10 ** 100).

Solution:-
# Create an iterator for range(3): small_value
small_value = iter(range(3))

# Print the values in small_value
print(next(small_value))
print(next(small_value))
print(next(small_value))

# Loop over range(3) and print the values
for num in range(3):
    print(num)


# Create an iterator for range(10 ** 100): googol
googol = iter(range(10**100))

# Print the first 5 values from googol
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))
print(next(googol))

Q3:-
Create a range object that would produce the values from 10 to 20 using range(). Assign the result to values.
Use the list() function to create a list of values from the range object values. Assign the result to values_list.
Use the sum() function to get the sum of the values from 10 to 20 from the range object values. Assign the result to values_sum.

Solution:-
# Create a range object: values
values = range(10,21)

# Print the range object
print(values)

# Create a list of integers: values_list
values_list = list(values)

# Print values_list
print(values_list)

# Get the sum of values: values_sum
values_sum = sum(values)

# Print values_sum
print(values_sum)

Q4:-
Create a list of tuples from mutants and assign the result to mutant_list. Make sure you generate the tuples using enumerate() and turn the result from it into a list using list().
Complete the first for loop by unpacking the tuples generated by calling enumerate() on mutants. Use index1 for the index and value1 for the value when unpacking the tuple.
Complete the second for loop similarly as with the first, but this time change the starting index to start from 1 by passing it in as an argument to the start parameter of enumerate(). Use index2 for the index and value2 for the value when unpacking the tuple.

Solution:-
# Create a list of strings: mutants
mutants = ['charles xavier', 
            'bobby drake', 
            'kurt wagner', 
            'max eisenhardt', 
            'kitty pride']

# Create a list of tuples: mutant_list
mutant_list = list(enumerate(mutants))

# Print the list of tuples
print(mutant_list)

# Unpack and print the tuple pairs
for index1,value1 in enumerate(mutants):
    print(index1, value1)

# Change the start index
for index2,value2 in enumerate(mutants, start=1):
    print(index2, value2)

Q5:-
Using zip() with list(), create a list of tuples from the three lists mutants, aliases, and powers (in that order) and assign the result to mutant_data.
Using zip(), create a zip object called mutant_zip from the three lists mutants, aliases, and powers.
Complete the for loop by unpacking the zip object you created and printing the tuple values. Use value1, value2, value3 for the values from each of mutants, aliases, and powers, in that order.

Solution:-
# Create a list of tuples: mutant_data
mutant_data = list(zip(mutants,aliases,powers))

# Print the list of tuples
print(list(mutant_data))

# Create a zip object using the three lists: mutant_zip
mutant_zip = zip(mutants,aliases,powers)

# Print the zip object
print(mutant_zip)

# Unpack the zip object and print the tuple values
for value1,value2,value3 in list(mutant_zip):
    print(value1, value2, value3)
    
Q6:-
Create a zip object by using zip() on mutants and powers, in that order. Assign the result to z1.
Print the tuples in z1 by unpacking them into positional arguments using the * operator in a print() call.
Because the previous print() call would have exhausted the elements in z1, recreate the zip object you defined earlier and assign the result again to z1.
'Unzip' the tuples in z1 by unpacking them into positional arguments using the * operator in a zip() call. Assign the results to result1 and result2, in that order.
The last print() statements prints the output of comparing result1 to mutants and result2 to powers. 
Click Submit Answer to see if the unpacked result1 and result2 are equivalent to mutants and powers, respectively.

Solution:-
# Create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants,powers)

# Print the tuples in z1 by unpacking with *
print(*z1)

# Re-create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants,powers)

# 'Unzip' the tuples in z1 by unpacking with * and zip(): result1, result2
result1, result2 = zip(*z1)

# Check if unpacked tuples are equivalent to original tuples
print(result1 == mutants)
print(result2 == powers)

Q7:-
Initialize an empty dictionary counts_dict for storing the results of processing the Twitter data.
Iterate over the 'tweets.csv' file by using a for loop. Use the loop variable chunk and iterate over the call to pd.read_csv() with a chunksize of 10.
In the inner loop, iterate over the column 'lang' in chunk by using a for loop. Use the loop variable entry

Solution:-
# Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
counts_dict = {}

# Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
for chunk in pd.read_csv('tweets.csv', chunksize=10):

    # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
    for entry in chunk['lang']:
        if entry in counts_dict.keys():
            counts_dict[entry] += 1
        else:
            counts_dict[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(counts_dict)

Q8:-
Define the function count_entries(), which has 3 parameters. The first parameter is csv_file for the filename, the second is c_size for the chunk size, and the last is colname for the column name.
Iterate over the file in csv_file file by using a for loop. Use the loop variable chunk and iterate over the call to pd.read_csv(), passing c_size to chunksize.
In the inner loop, iterate over the column given by colname in chunk by using a for loop. Use the loop variable entry.
Call the count_entries() function by passing to it the filename 'tweets.csv', the size of chunks 10, and the name of the column to count, 'lang'. Assign the result of the call to the variable result_counts.

Solution:-
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(csv_file,c_size,colname):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
    counts_dict = {}

    # Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(csv_file,chunksize=c_size):

        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
        for entry in chunk[colname]:
            if entry in counts_dict.keys():
                counts_dict[entry] += 1
            else:
                counts_dict[entry] = 1

    # Return counts_dict
    return counts_dict

# Call count_entries(): result_counts
result_counts = count_entries('tweets.csv',10,'lang')

# Print result_counts
print(result_counts)
