Q1:-
Create a zip object by calling zip() and passing to it feature_names and row_vals. Assign the result to zipped_lists.
Create a dictionary from the zipped_lists zip object by calling dict() with zipped_lists. Assign the resulting dictionary to rs_dict.

Solution:-
# Zip lists: zipped_lists
zipped_lists = zip(feature_names,row_vals)

# Create a dictionary: rs_dict
rs_dict = dict(zipped_lists)

# Print the dictionary
print(rs_dict)

Q2:-
Define the function lists2dict() with two parameters: first is list1 and second is list2.
Return the resulting dictionary rs_dict in lists2dict().
Call the lists2dict() function with the arguments feature_names and row_vals. Assign the result of the function call to rs_fxn.

Solution:-
# Define lists2dict()
def lists2dict(list1, list2):
    """Return a dictionary where list1 provides
    the keys and list2 provides the values."""

    # Zip lists: zipped_lists
    zipped_lists = zip(list1, list2)

    # Create a dictionary: rs_dict
    rs_dict = dict(zipped_lists)

    # Return the dictionary
    return rs_dict

# Call lists2dict: rs_fxn
rs_fxn = lists2dict(feature_names,row_vals)

# Print rs_fxn
print(rs_fxn)

Q3:-
Inspect the contents of row_lists by printing the first two lists in row_lists.
Create a list comprehension that generates a dictionary using lists2dict() for each sublist in row_lists. The keys are from the feature_names list and the values are the row entries in row_lists. Use sublist as your iterator variable and assign the resulting list of dictionaries to list_of_dicts.
Look at the first two dictionaries in list_of_dicts by printing them out.

Solution:-
# Print the first two lists in row_lists
print(row_lists[0])
print(row_lists[1])

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Print the first two dictionaries in list_of_dicts
print(list_of_dicts[0])
print(list_of_dicts[1])

Q4:-
To use the DataFrame() function you need, first import the pandas package with the alias pd.
Create a DataFrame from the list of dictionaries in list_of_dicts by calling pd.DataFrame(). Assign the resulting DataFrame to df.
Inspect the contents of df by printing the head of the DataFrame.

Solution:-
# Import the pandas package
import pandas as pd

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Turn list of dicts into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(list_of_dicts)

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

Q5:-
Use open() to bind the csv file 'world_dev_ind.csv' as file in the context manager.
Complete the for loop so that it iterates 1000 times to perform the loop body and process only the first 1000 rows of data of the file.

Solution:-
# Open a connection to the file
with open('world_dev_ind.csv') as file:

    # Skip the column names
    file.readline()

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
    counts_dict = {}

    # Process only the first 1000 rows
    for j in range(1000):

        # Split the current line into a list: line
        line = file.readline().split(',')

        # Get the value for the first column: first_col
        first_col = line[0]

        # If the column value is in the dict, increment its value
        if first_col in counts_dict.keys():
            counts_dict[first_col] += 1

        # Else, add to the dict and set value to 1
        else:
            counts_dict[first_col] = 1

# Print the resulting dictionary
print(counts_dict)

Q6:-
In the function read_large_file(), read a line from file_object by using the method readline(). Assign the result to data.
In the function read_large_file(), yield the line read from the file data.
In the context manager, create a generator object gen_file by calling your generator function read_large_file() and passing file to it.
Print the first three lines produced by the generator object gen_file using next().

Solution:-
# Define read_large_file()
def read_large_file(file_object):
    """A generator function to read a large file lazily."""

    # Loop indefinitely until the end of the file
    while True:

        # Read a line from the file: data
        data = file_object.readline()

        # Break if this is the end of the file
        if not data:
            break

        # Yield the line of data
        yield data
        
# Open a connection to the file
with open('world_dev_ind.csv') as file:

    # Create a generator object for the file: gen_file
    gen_file = read_large_file(file)

    # Print the first three lines of the file
    print(next(gen_file))
    print(next(gen_file))
    print(next(gen_file))
    
 Q7:-
 Bind the file 'world_dev_ind.csv' to file in the context manager with open().
Complete the for loop so that it iterates over the generator from the call to read_large_file() to process all the rows of the file.

Solution:-
# Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
counts_dict = {}

# Open a connection to the file
with open('world_dev_ind.csv') as file:

    # Iterate over the generator from read_large_file()
    for line in read_large_file(file):

        row = line.split(',')
        first_col = row[0]

        if first_col in counts_dict.keys():
            counts_dict[first_col] += 1
        else:
            counts_dict[first_col] = 1

# Print            
print(counts_dict)

Q8:-
Use pd.read_csv() to read in 'ind_pop.csv' in chunks of size 10. Assign the result to df_reader.
Print the first two chunks from df_reader.

Solution:-
# Import the pandas package
import pandas as pd

# Initialize reader object: df_reader
df_reader = pd.read_csv('ind_pop.csv', chunksize=10)

# Print two chunks
print(next(df_reader))
print(next(df_reader))

Q9:-
Use pd.read_csv() to read in the file in 'ind_pop_data.csv' in chunks of size 1000. Assign the result to urb_pop_reader.
Get the first DataFrame chunk from the iterable urb_pop_reader and assign this to df_urb_pop.
Select only the rows of df_urb_pop that have a 'CountryCode' of 'CEB'. To do this, compare whether df_urb_pop['CountryCode'] is equal to 'CEB' within the square brackets in df_urb_pop[____].
Using zip(), zip together the 'Total Population' and 'Urban population (% of total)' columns of df_pop_ceb. Assign the resulting zip object to pops.

Solution:-
# Initialize reader object: urb_pop_reader
urb_pop_reader = pd.read_csv('ind_pop_data.csv', chunksize=1000)

# Get the first DataFrame chunk: df_urb_pop
df_urb_pop = next(urb_pop_reader)

# Check out the head of the DataFrame
print(df_urb_pop.head())

# Check out specific country: df_pop_ceb
df_pop_ceb = df_urb_pop[df_urb_pop['CountryCode']=='CEB']

# Zip DataFrame columns of interest: pops
pops = zip(df_pop_ceb['Total Population'], df_pop_ceb['Urban population (% of total)'])

# Turn zip object into list: pops_list
pops_list = list(pops)

# Print pops_list
print(pops_list)

Q10:-
Use pd.read_csv() to read in the file 'ind_pop_data.csv' in chunks of size 1000. Assign the result to urb_pop_reader.
Write a list comprehension to generate a list of values from pops_list for the new column 'Total Urban Population'. Use tup as the iterator variable. The output expression should be the product of the first and second element in each tuple in pops_list. Because the 2nd element is a percentage, you also need to either multiply the result by 0.01 or divide it by 100. In addition, note that the column 'Total Urban Population' should only be able to take on integer values. To ensure this, make sure you cast the output expression to an integer with int().
Create a scatter plot where the x-axis are values from the 'Year' column and the y-axis are values from the 'Total Urban Population' column.

Solution:-
