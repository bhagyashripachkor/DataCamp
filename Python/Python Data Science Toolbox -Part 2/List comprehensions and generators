Q1:-
Using the range of numbers from 0 to 9 as your iterable and i as your iterator variable, write a list comprehension that produces a list of numbers consisting of the squared values of i.

Solution:-
# Create list comprehension: squares
squares = [i*i for i in range(0,10)]

Q2:-
In the inner list comprehension - that is, the output expression of the nested list comprehension - create a list of values from 0 to 4 using range(). Use col as the iterator variable.
In the iterable part of your nested list comprehension, use range() to count 5 rows - that is, create a list of values from 0 to 4. 
Use row as the iterator variable; note that you won't be needing this to create values in the list of lists.

Solution:-
# Create a 5 x 5 matrix using a list of lists: matrix
matrix = [[col for col in range(0,5)] for row in range(0,5)]

# Print the matrix
for row in matrix:
    print(row)

Q3:-
Use member as the iterator variable in the list comprehension. For the conditional, use len() to evaluate the iterator variable. 
Note that you only want strings with 7 characters or more.

Solution:-
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member for member in fellowship if len(member) >= 7]

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)

Q4:-
In the output expression, keep the string as-is if the number of characters is >= 7, else replace it with an empty string - that is, '' or "".

Solution:-
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create list comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = [member if len(member) >= 7 else "" for member in fellowship]

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)

Q5:-
Create a dict comprehension where the key is a string in fellowship and the value is the length of the string. 
Remember to use the syntax key:value in the output expression part of the comprehension to create the members of the dictionary. 
Use member as the iterator variable.

Solution:-
# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create dict comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = {member:len(member) for member in fellowship}

# Print the new list
print(new_fellowship)

Q6:-
Create a generator object that will produce values from 0 to 30. Assign the result to result and use num as the iterator variable in the generator expression.
Print the first 5 values by using next() appropriately in print().
Print the rest of the values by using a for loop to iterate over the generator object.

Solution:-
# Create generator object: result
result = (num for num in range(0,31))

# Print the first 5 values
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))

# Print the rest of the values
for value in result:
    print(value)

Q7:-
Write a generator expression that will generate the lengths of each string in lannister. Use person as the iterator variable. Assign the result to lengths.
Supply the correct iterable in the for loop for printing the values in the generator object.

Solution:-
# Create a list of strings: lannister
lannister = ['cersei', 'jaime', 'tywin', 'tyrion', 'joffrey']

# Create a generator object: lengths
lengths = (len(person) for person in lannister )

# Iterate over and print the values in lengths
for value in lengths:
    print(value)
    
Q8:-
Complete the function header for the function get_lengths() that has a single parameter, input_list.
In the for loop in the function definition, yield the length of the strings in input_list.
Complete the iterable part of the for loop for printing the values generated by the get_lengths() generator function. 
Supply the call to get_lengths(), passing in the list lannister.

Solution:-
# Define generator function get_lengths
def get_lengths(input_list):
    """Generator function that yields the
    length of the strings in input_list."""

    # Yield the length of a string
    for person in input_list:
        yield len(person)

# Print the values generated by get_lengths()
for value in get_lengths(lannister):
    print(value)
    
Q9:-
Extract the column 'created_at' from df and assign the result to tweet_time. Fun fact: the extracted column in tweet_time here is a Series data structure!
Create a list comprehension that extracts the time from each row in tweet_time. Each row is a string that represents a timestamp, and you will access the 12th to 19th characters in the string to extract the time.
Use entry as the iterator variable and assign the result to tweet_clock_time. Remember that Python uses 0-based indexing!

Solution:-
# Extract the created_at column from df: tweet_time
tweet_time = df['created_at']

# Extract the clock time: tweet_clock_time
tweet_clock_time = [entry[11:19] for entry in tweet_time]

# Print the extracted times
print(tweet_clock_time)

Q10:-
Extract the column 'created_at' from df and assign the result to tweet_time.
Create a list comprehension that extracts the time from each row in tweet_time. 
Each row is a string that represents a timestamp, and you will access the 12th to 19th characters in the string to extract the time. 
Use entry as the iterator variable and assign the result to tweet_clock_time.

Solution:-
# Extract the created_at column from df: tweet_time
tweet_time = df['created_at']

# Extract the clock time: tweet_clock_time
tweet_clock_time = [entry[11:19] for entry in tweet_time if entry[17:19] == '19']

# Print the extracted times
print(tweet_clock_time)


Additionally, add a conditional expression that checks whether entry[17:19] is equal to '19'.
