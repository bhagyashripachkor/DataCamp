Q1:-
Import pandas as pd.
Read the file 'Bronze.csv' into a DataFrame called bronze.
Read the file 'Silver.csv' into a DataFrame called silver.
Read the file 'Gold.csv' into a DataFrame called gold.
Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame gold. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results.

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read 'Bronze.csv' into a DataFrame: bronze
bronze = pd.read_csv('Bronze.csv')

# Read 'Silver.csv' into a DataFrame: silver
silver = pd.read_csv('Silver.csv')

# Read 'Gold.csv' into a DataFrame: gold
gold = pd.read_csv('Gold.csv')

# Print the first five rows of gold
print(gold.head())

Q2:-
Create a list of file names called filenames with three strings 'Gold.csv', 'Silver.csv', & 'Bronze.csv'. This has been done for you.
Use a for loop to create another list called dataframes containing the three DataFrames loaded from filenames:
Iterate over filenames.
Read each CSV file in filenames into a DataFrame and append it to dataframes by using pd.read_csv() inside a call to .append().
Print the first 5 rows of the first DataFrame of the list dataframes. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results.

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create the list of file names: filenames
filenames = ['Gold.csv', 'Silver.csv', 'Bronze.csv']

# Create the list of three DataFrames: dataframes
dataframes = []
for filename in filenames:
    dataframes.append(pd.read_csv(filename))

# Print top 5 rows of 1st DataFrame in dataframes
print(dataframes[0].head())

Q3:-
Construct a copy of the DataFrame gold called medals using the .copy() method.
Create a list called new_labels with entries 'NOC', 'Country', & 'Gold'. This is the same as the column labels from gold with the column label 'Total' replaced by 'Gold'.
Rename the columns of medals by assigning new_labels to medals.columns.
Create new columns 'Silver' and 'Bronze' in medals using silver['Total'] & bronze['Total'].
Print the top 5 rows of the final DataFrame medals. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Make a copy of gold: medals
medals = gold.copy()

# Create list of new column labels: new_labels
new_labels = ['NOC', 'Country', 'Gold']

# Rename the columns of medals using new_labels
medals.columns = new_labels

# Add columns 'Silver' & 'Bronze' to medals
medals['Silver'] = silver['Total']
medals['Bronze'] = bronze['Total']

# Print the head of medals
print(medals.head())

Q4:-
Read 'monthly_max_temp.csv' into a DataFrame called weather1 with 'Month' as the index.
Sort the index of weather1 in alphabetical order using the .sort_index() method and store the result in weather2.
Sort the index of weather1 in reverse alphabetical order by specifying the additional keyword argument ascending=False inside .sort_index().
Use the .sort_values() method to sort weather1 in increasing numerical order according to the values of the column 'Max TemperatureF'.

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read 'monthly_max_temp.csv' into a DataFrame: weather1
weather1 = pd.read_csv('monthly_max_temp.csv', index_col='Month')

# Print the head of weather1
print(weather1.head())

# Sort the index of weather1 in alphabetical order: weather2
weather2 = weather1.sort_index()

# Print the head of weather2
print(weather2.head())

# Sort the index of weather1 in reverse alphabetical order: weather3
weather3 = weather1.sort_index(ascending=False)

# Print the head of weather3
print(weather3.head())

# Sort weather1 numerically using the values of 'Max TemperatureF': weather4
weather4 = weather1.sort_values('Max TemperatureF')

# Print the head of weather4
print(weather4.head())

Q5:-
Reorder the rows of weather1 using the .reindex() method with the list year as the argument, which contains the abbreviations for each month.
Reorder the rows of weather1 just as you did above, this time chaining the .ffill() method to replace the null values with the last preceding non-null value.

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Reindex weather1 using the list year: weather2
weather2 = weather1.reindex(year)

# Print weather2
print(weather2)

# Reindex weather1 using the list year with forward-fill: weather3
weather3 = weather1.reindex(year).ffill()

# Print weather3
print(weather3)

Q6:-
Create a new DataFrame common_names by reindexing names_1981 using the Index of the DataFrame names_1881 of older names.
Print the shape of the new common_names DataFrame. This has been done for you. It should be the same as that of names_1881.
Drop the rows of common_names that have null counts using the .dropna() method. These rows correspond to names that fell out of fashion between 1881 & 1981.
Print the shape of the reassigned common_names DataFrame. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Reindex names_1981 with index of names_1881: common_names
common_names = names_1981.reindex(names_1881.index)

# Print shape of common_names
print(common_names.shape)

# Drop rows with null counts: common_names
common_names = common_names.dropna()

# Print shape of new common_names
print(common_names.shape)

Q7:-
Create a new DataFrame temps_f by extracting the columns 'Min TemperatureF', 'Mean TemperatureF', & 'Max TemperatureF' from weather as a new DataFrame temps_f. To do this, pass the relevant columns as a list to weather[].
Create a new DataFrame temps_c from temps_f using the formula (temps_f - 32) * 5/9.
Rename the columns of temps_c to replace 'F' with 'C' using the .str.replace('F', 'C') method on temps_c.columns.
Print the first 5 rows of DataFrame temps_c. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

Solution:-
# Extract selected columns from weather as new DataFrame: temps_f
temps_f = weather[['Min TemperatureF','Mean TemperatureF','Max TemperatureF']]

# Convert temps_f to celsius: temps_c
temps_c = (temps_f - 32) * 5/9

# Rename 'F' in column names with 'C': temps_c.columns
temps_c.columns = temps_c.columns.str.replace('F', 'C')

# Print first 5 rows of temps_c
print(temps_c.head())

Q8:-
Read the file 'GDP.csv' into a DataFrame called gdp.
Use parse_dates=True and index_col='DATE'.
Create a DataFrame post2008 by slicing gdp such that it comprises all rows from 2008 onward.
Print the last 8 rows of the slice post2008. This has been done for you. This data has quarterly frequency so the indices are separated by three-month intervals.
Create the DataFrame yearly by resampling the slice post2008 by year. Remember, you need to chain .resample() (using the alias 'A' for annual frequency) with some kind of aggregation; you will use the aggregation method .last() to select the last element when resampling.
Compute the percentage growth of the resampled DataFrame yearly with .pct_change() * 100.

Solution:-
import pandas as pd

# Read 'GDP.csv' into a DataFrame: gdp
gdp = pd.read_csv('GDP.csv', index_col='DATE',parse_dates=True)

# Slice all the gdp data from 2008 onward: post2008
post2008 = gdp.loc['2008':]

# Print the last 8 rows of post2008
print(post2008.tail(8))

# Resample post2008 by year, keeping last(): yearly
yearly = post2008.resample('A').last()

# Print yearly
print(yearly)

# Compute percentage growth of yearly: yearly['growth']
yearly['growth'] = yearly.pct_change()*100

# Print yearly again
print(yearly)

Q9:-
Read the DataFrames sp500 & exchange from the files 'sp500.csv' & 'exchange.csv' respectively..
Use parse_dates=True and index_col='Date'.
Extract the columns 'Open' & 'Close' from the DataFrame sp500 as a new DataFrame dollars and print the first 5 rows.
Construct a new DataFrame pounds by converting US dollars to British pounds. You'll use the .multiply() method of dollars with exchange['GBP/USD'] and axis='rows'
Print the first 5 rows of the new DataFrame pounds. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results!.

Solution:-
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read 'sp500.csv' into a DataFrame: sp500
sp500 = pd.read_csv('sp500.csv', index_col='Date',parse_dates=True)

# Read 'exchange.csv' into a DataFrame: exchange
exchange = pd.read_csv('exchange.csv', index_col='Date',parse_dates=True)

# Subset 'Open' & 'Close' columns from sp500: dollars
dollars = sp500[['Open','Close']]

# Print the head of dollars
print(dollars.head())

# Convert dollars to pounds: pounds
pounds = dollars.multiply(exchange['GBP/USD'],axis='rows')

# Print the head of pounds
print(pounds.head())
