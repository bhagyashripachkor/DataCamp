Q1:-
In the editor on the right, write code to see if True equals False.
Write Python code to check if -5 * 15 is not equal to 75.
Ask Python whether the strings "pyscript" and "PyScript" are equal.
What happens if you compare booleans and integers? Write code to see if True and 1 are equal.

Solution:-
# Comparison of booleans
print(True==False)

# Comparison of integers
print(-5 * 15 != 75)

# Comparison of strings
print("pyscript" == "PyScript")

# Compare a boolean with an integer
print(True == 1)

Q2:-
Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
x is greater than or equal to -10. x has already been defined for you.
"test" is less than or equal to y. y has already been defined for you.
True is greater than False.

Solution:-
# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6
print(x >= -10)

# Comparison of strings
y = "test"
print("test" <= y)

# Comparison of booleans
print(True > False)

Q3:-
Using comparison operators, generate boolean arrays that answer the following questions:
Which areas in my_house are greater than or equal to 18?
You can also compare two Numpy arrays element-wise. Which areas in my_house are smaller than the ones in your_house?
Make sure to wrap both commands in a print() statement, so that you can inspect the output.

Solution:-
# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than or equal to 18
print(my_house >= 18)

# my_house less than your_house
print(my_house < your_house)

Q4:-
Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
my_kitchen is bigger than 10 and smaller than 18.
my_kitchen is smaller than 14 or bigger than 17.
double the area of my_kitchen is smaller than triple the area of your_kitchen

Solution:-
# Define variables
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

# my_kitchen bigger than 10 and smaller than 18?
print(my_kitchen > 10 and my_kitchen < 18)

# my_kitchen smaller than 14 or bigger than 17?
print(my_kitchen < 14 or my_kitchen > 17)

# Double my_kitchen smaller than triple your_kitchen?
print(my_kitchen*2 < your_kitchen*3)

Q5:-
Generate boolean arrays that answer the following questions:
Which areas in my_house are greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10?
Which areas are smaller than 11 in both my_house and your_house? Make sure to wrap both commands in print() statement, so that you can inspect the output.

Solution:-
# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10
print(np.logical_or(my_house > 18.5,my_house < 10))

# Both my_house and your_house smaller than 11
print(np.logical_and(my_house < 11, your_house < 11))

Q6;-Examine the if statement that prints out "Looking around in the kitchen." if room equals "kit".
Write another if statement that prints out "big place!" if area is greater than 15.

Solution:-
# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if statement for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if statement for area
if area>15:
    print("big place!")
    
    Q7:-
    Add an else statement to the second control structure so that "pretty small." is printed out if area > 15 evaluates to False.
    
    Solution:-
    # Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
else:
    print("pretty small.")
    
    Q8:-
    Add an elif to the second control structure such that "medium size, nice!" is printed out if area is greater than 10.
    
    Solution:-
    # Define variables
room = "bed"
area = 14.0

# if-elif-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
elif room == "bed":
    print("looking around in the bedroom.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-elif-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
elif area > 10:
    print("medium size, nice!")
else :
    print("pretty small.")
    
    Q9:-
    Extract the drives_right column as a Pandas Series and store it as dr.
Use dr, a boolean Series, to subset the cars DataFrame. Store the resulting selection in sel.
Print sel, and assert that drives_right is True for all observations.

Solution:-
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr = cars["drives_right"]

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars[dr]
# Print sel
print(sel)

Q10:-
Convert the code on the right to a one-liner that calculates the variable sel as before.

Solution:-
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner

sel = cars[cars['drives_right']]

# Print sel
print(sel)

Q11:-
Select the cars_per_cap column from cars as a Pandas Series and store it as cpc.
Use cpc in combination with a comparison operator and 500. You want to end up with a boolean Series that's True if the corresponding country has a cars_per_cap of more than 500 and False otherwise. Store this boolean Series as many_cars.
Use many_cars to subset cars, similar to what you did before. Store the result as car_maniac.
Print out car_maniac to see if you got it right.

Solution:-
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500
cpc = cars["cars_per_cap"]
many_cars = cpc > 500
car_maniac = cars[many_cars]

# Print car_maniac
print(car_maniac)

Q12:-
Use the code sample above to create a DataFrame medium, that includes all the observations of cars that have a cars_per_cap between 100 and 500.
Print out medium.

Solution:-
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
medium = cars[np.logical_and(cars["cars_per_cap"] >100, cars["cars_per_cap"] < 500)] 



# Print medium
print(medium)
