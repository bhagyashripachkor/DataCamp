Q1:-
Import numpy and pandas as their standard aliases.
Read the file 'gapminder.csv' into a DataFrame df using the read_csv() function.
Create array X for the 'fertility' feature and array y for the 'life' target variable.
Reshape the arrays by using the .reshape() method and passing in -1 and 1.

Solution:-
# Import numpy and pandas
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')

# Create arrays for features and target variable
y = df.life.values
X = df.fertility.values

# Print the dimensions of X and y before reshaping
print("Dimensions of y before reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X before reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))

# Reshape X and y
y = y.reshape(-1,1)
X = X.reshape(-1,1)

# Print the dimensions of X and y after reshaping
print("Dimensions of y after reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X after reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))
