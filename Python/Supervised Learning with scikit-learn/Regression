Q1:-
Import numpy and pandas as their standard aliases.
Read the file 'gapminder.csv' into a DataFrame df using the read_csv() function.
Create array X for the 'fertility' feature and array y for the 'life' target variable.
Reshape the arrays by using the .reshape() method and passing in -1 and 1.

Solution:-
# Import numpy and pandas
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')

# Create arrays for features and target variable
y = df.life.values
X = df.fertility.values

# Print the dimensions of X and y before reshaping
print("Dimensions of y before reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X before reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))

# Reshape X and y
y = y.reshape(-1,1)
X = X.reshape(-1,1)

# Print the dimensions of X and y after reshaping
print("Dimensions of y after reshaping: {}".format(y.shape))
print("Dimensions of X after reshaping: {}".format(X.shape))

Q2:-
Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model.
Create a LinearRegression regressor called reg.
Set up the prediction space to range from the minimum to the maximum of X_fertility. This has been done for you.
Fit the regressor to the data (X_fertility and y) and compute its predictions using the .predict() method and the prediction_space array.
Compute and print the R2 score using the .score() method.
Overlay the plot with your linear regression line. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

Solution:-
# Import LinearRegression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create the regressor: reg
reg = LinearRegression()

# Create the prediction space
prediction_space = np.linspace(min(X_fertility), max(X_fertility)).reshape(-1,1)

# Fit the model to the data
reg.fit(X_fertility,y)

# Compute predictions over the prediction space: y_pred
y_pred = reg.predict(prediction_space)

# Print R^2 
print(reg.score(X_fertility,y))

# Plot regression line
plt.plot(prediction_space, y_pred, color='black', linewidth=3)
plt.show()

Q3:-
Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model, mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics, and train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Using X and y, create training and test sets such that 30% is used for testing and 70% for training. Use a random state of 42.
Create a linear regression regressor called reg_all, fit it to the training set, and evaluate it on the test set.
Compute and print the R2 score using the .score() method on the test set.
Compute and print the RMSE. To do this, first compute the Mean Squared Error using the mean_squared_error() function with the arguments y_test and y_pred, and then take its square root using np.sqrt().

Solution:-
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


# Create training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3, random_state=42)

# Create the regressor: reg_all
reg_all = LinearRegression()

# Fit the regressor to the training data
reg_all.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Predict on the test data: y_pred
y_pred = reg_all.predict(X_test)

# Compute and print R^2 and RMSE
print("R^2: {}".format(reg_all.score(X_test, y_test)))
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test,y_pred))
print("Root Mean Squared Error: {}".format(rmse))

Q4:-
Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model and cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection.
Create a linear regression regressor called reg.
Use the cross_val_score() function to perform 5-fold cross-validation on X and y.
Compute and print the average cross-validation score. You can use NumPy's mean() function to compute the average.

Solution:-
# Import the necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Create a linear regression object: reg
reg = LinearRegression()

# Compute 5-fold cross-validation scores: cv_scores
cv_scores = cross_val_score(reg,X,y,cv=5)

# Print the 5-fold cross-validation scores
print(cv_scores)

print("Average 5-Fold CV Score: {}".format(np.mean(cv_scores)))

Q5:-
Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model and cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection.
Create a linear regression regressor called reg.
Perform 3-fold CV and then 10-fold CV. Compare the resulting mean scores.

Solution:-
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Create a linear regression object: reg
reg = LinearRegression()

# Perform 3-fold CV
cvscores_3 = cross_val_score(reg,X,y,cv=3)
print(np.mean(cvscores_3))

# Perform 10-fold CV
cvscores_10 = cross_val_score(reg,X,y,cv=10)
print(np.mean(cvscores_10))

Q6:-
Import Lasso from sklearn.linear_model.
Instantiate a Lasso regressor with an alpha of 0.4 and specify normalize=True.
Fit the regressor to the data and compute the coefficients using the coef_ attribute.

Solution:-
# Import Lasso
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

# Instantiate a lasso regressor: lasso
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.4,normalize=True)

# Fit the regressor to the data
lasso.fit(X,y)

# Compute and print the coefficients
lasso_coef = lasso.coef_
print(lasso_coef)

# Plot the coefficients
plt.plot(range(len(df_columns)), lasso_coef)
plt.xticks(range(len(df_columns)), df_columns.values, rotation=60)
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.show()

Q7:-
Instantiate a Ridge regressor and specify normalize=True.
Inside the for loop:
Specify the alpha value for the regressor to use.
Perform 10-fold cross-validation on the regressor with the specified alpha. The data is available in the arrays X and y.
Append the average and the standard deviation of the computed cross-validated scores. NumPy has been pre-imported for you as np.
Use the display_plot() function to visualize the scores and standard deviations.

Solution:-
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

# Setup the array of alphas and lists to store scores
alpha_space = np.logspace(-4, 0, 50)
ridge_scores = []
ridge_scores_std = []

# Create a ridge regressor: ridge
ridge = Ridge(normalize=True)

# Compute scores over range of alphas
for alpha in alpha_space:

    # Specify the alpha value to use: ridge.alpha
    ridge.alpha = alpha
    
    # Perform 10-fold CV: ridge_cv_scores
    ridge_cv_scores = cross_val_score(ridge,X,y,cv=10)
    
    # Append the mean of ridge_cv_scores to ridge_scores
    ridge_scores.append(np.mean(ridge_cv_scores))
    
    # Append the std of ridge_cv_scores to ridge_scores_std
    ridge_scores_std.append(np.std(ridge_cv_scores))

# Display the plot
display_plot(ridge_scores, ridge_scores_std)
