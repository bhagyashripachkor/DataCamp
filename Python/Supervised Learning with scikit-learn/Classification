Q1:-
Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.
Create arrays X and y for the features and the target variable. Here this has been done for you. Note the use of .drop() to drop the target variable 'party' from the feature array X as well as the use of the .values attribute to ensure X and y are NumPy arrays. Without using .values, X and y are a DataFrame and Series respectively; the scikit-learn API will accept them in this form also as long as they are of the right shape.
Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier called knn with 6 neighbors by specifying the n_neighbors parameter.
Fit the classifier to the data using the .fit() method.

Solution:-
# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party', axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X,y)

Q2:-
Create arrays for the features and the target variable from df. As a reminder, the target variable is 'party'.
Instantiate a KNeighborsClassifier with 6 neighbors.
Fit the classifier to the data.
Predict the labels of the training data, X.
Predict the label of the new data point X_new.

Solution:-
# Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier 

# Create arrays for the features and the response variable
y = df['party'].values
X = df.drop('party',axis=1).values

# Create a k-NN classifier with 6 neighbors: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=6)

# Fit the classifier to the data
knn.fit(X,y)

# Predict the labels for the training data X
y_pred = knn.predict(X)

# Predict and print the label for the new data point X_new
new_prediction = knn.predict(X_new)
print("Prediction: {}".format(new_prediction))

Q3:-
Import datasets from sklearn and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Load the digits dataset using the .load_digits() method on datasets.
Print the keys and DESCR of digits.
Print the shape of images and data keys using the . notation.
Display the 1011th image using plt.imshow(). This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see which handwritten digit this happens to be!

Solution:-
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn import datasets
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the digits dataset: digits
digits = datasets.load_digits()

# Print the keys and DESCR of the dataset
print(digits.DESCR)
print(digits.keys())

# Print the shape of the images and data keys
print(digits.images.shape)
print(digits.data.shape)

# Display digit 1010
plt.imshow(digits.images[1010], cmap=plt.cm.gray_r, interpolation='nearest')
plt.show()

Q4:-
Import KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors and train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Create an array for the features using digits.data and an array for the target using digits.target.
Create stratified training and test sets using 0.2 for the size of the test set. Use a random state of 42. Stratify the split according to the labels so that they are distributed in the training and test sets as they are in the original dataset.
Create a k-NN classifier with 7 neighbors and fit it to the training data.
Compute and print the accuracy of the classifier's predictions using the .score() method.

Solution:-
# Import necessary modules
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
digits = datasets.load_digits()

# Create feature and target arrays
X = digits.data
y = digits.target

# Split into training and test set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# Create a k-NN classifier with 7 neighbors: knn
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=7)

# Fit the classifier to the training data
knn.fit(X_train,y_train)

# Print the accuracy
print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))

Q5:-
Inside the for loop:
Setup a k-NN classifier with the number of neighbors equal to k.
Fit the classifier with k neighbors to the training data.
Compute accuracy scores the training set and test set separately using the .score() method and assign the results to the train_accuracy and test_accuracy arrays respectively.

Solution:-
# Setup arrays to store train and test accuracies
neighbors = np.arange(1, 9)
train_accuracy = np.empty(len(neighbors))
test_accuracy = np.empty(len(neighbors))

# Loop over different values of k
for i, k in enumerate(neighbors):
    # Setup a k-NN Classifier with k neighbors: knn
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)

    # Fit the classifier to the training data
    knn.fit(X_train,y_train)
    
    #Compute accuracy on the training set
    train_accuracy[i] = knn.score(X_train, y_train)

    #Compute accuracy on the testing set
    test_accuracy[i] = knn.score(X_test, y_test)

# Generate plot
plt.title('k-NN: Varying Number of Neighbors')
plt.plot(neighbors, test_accuracy, label = 'Testing Accuracy')
plt.plot(neighbors, train_accuracy, label = 'Training Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Number of Neighbors')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.show()
