Q1:-
Write a for loop to acquire 50 bootstrap samples of the rainfall data and plot their ECDF.
Use np.random.choice() to generate a bootstrap sample from the NumPy array rainfall. Be sure that the size of the resampled array is len(rainfall).
Use the function ecdf() that you wrote in the prequel to this course to generate the x and y values for the ECDF of the bootstrap sample bs_sample.
Plot the ECDF values. Specify color='gray' (to make gray dots) and alpha=0.1 (to make them semi-transparent, since we are overlaying so many) in addition to the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
Use ecdf() to generate x and y values for the ECDF of the original rainfall data available in the array rainfall.
Plot the ECDF values of the original data.

Solution:-
for _ in range(50):
    # Generate bootstrap sample: bs_sample
    bs_sample = np.random.choice(rainfall, size=len(rainfall))

    # Compute and plot ECDF from bootstrap sample
    x, y = ecdf(bs_sample)
    _ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='gray', alpha=0.1)

# Compute and plot ECDF from original data
x, y = ecdf(rainfall)
_ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.')

# Make margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('yearly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
