Q1:-
Write a for loop to acquire 50 bootstrap samples of the rainfall data and plot their ECDF.
Use np.random.choice() to generate a bootstrap sample from the NumPy array rainfall. Be sure that the size of the resampled array is len(rainfall).
Use the function ecdf() that you wrote in the prequel to this course to generate the x and y values for the ECDF of the bootstrap sample bs_sample.
Plot the ECDF values. Specify color='gray' (to make gray dots) and alpha=0.1 (to make them semi-transparent, since we are overlaying so many) in addition to the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
Use ecdf() to generate x and y values for the ECDF of the original rainfall data available in the array rainfall.
Plot the ECDF values of the original data.

Solution:-
for _ in range(50):
    # Generate bootstrap sample: bs_sample
    bs_sample = np.random.choice(rainfall, size=len(rainfall))

    # Compute and plot ECDF from bootstrap sample
    x, y = ecdf(bs_sample)
    _ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.', linestyle='none',
                 color='gray', alpha=0.1)

# Compute and plot ECDF from original data
x, y = ecdf(rainfall)
_ = plt.plot(x, y, marker='.')

# Make margins and label axes
plt.margins(0.02)
_ = plt.xlabel('yearly rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('ECDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Q2:-
Define a function with call signature draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1).
Using np.empty(), initialize an array called bs_replicates of size size to hold all of the bootstrap replicates.
Write a for loop that ranges over size and computes a replicate using bootstrap_replicate_1d(). Refer to the exercise description above to see the function signature of bootstrap_replicate_1d(). Store the replicate in the appropriate index of bs_replicates.
Return the array of replicates bs_replicates. This has already been done for you.

Solution:-
def draw_bs_reps(data, func, size=1):
    """Draw bootstrap replicates."""

    # Initialize array of replicates: bs_replicates
    bs_replicates = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_replicates[i] = bootstrap_replicate_1d(data,func)

    return bs_replicates

Q3:-
Draw 10000 bootstrap replicates of the mean annual rainfall using your draw_bs_reps() function and the rainfall array. Hint: Pass in np.mean for func to compute the mean.
As a reminder, draw_bs_reps() accepts 3 arguments: data, func, and size.
Compute and print the standard error of the mean of rainfall.
The formula to compute this is np.std(data) / np.sqrt(len(data)).
Compute and print the standard deviation of your bootstrap replicates bs_replicates.
Make a histogram of the replicates using the normed=True keyword argument and 50 bins.

Solution:-
# Take 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the mean: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall,np.mean,10000)

# Compute and print SEM
sem = np.std(rainfall) / np.sqrt(len(rainfall))
print(sem)

# Compute and print standard deviation of bootstrap replicates
bs_std = np.std(bs_replicates) 
print(bs_std)

# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('mean annual rainfall (mm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Q4:-
Draw 10000 bootstrap replicates of the variance in annual rainfall, stored in the rainfall dataset, using your draw_bs_reps() function. Hint: Pass in np.var for computing the variance.
Divide your variance replicates (bs_replicates) by 100 to put the variance in units of square centimeters for convenience.
Make a histogram of bs_replicates using the normed=True keyword argument and 50 bins.

Solution:-
# Generate 10,000 bootstrap replicates of the variance: bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(rainfall,np.var,10000)

# Put the variance in units of square centimeters
bs_replicates = bs_replicates/100

# Make a histogram of the results
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('variance of annual rainfall (sq. cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Q5:-
Generate 10000 bootstrap replicates of τ from the nohitter_times data using your draw_bs_reps() function. Recall that the the optimal τ is calculated as the mean of the data.
Compute the 95% confidence interval using np.percentile() and passing in two arguments: The array bs_replicates, and the list of percentiles - in this case 2.5 and 97.5.
Print the confidence interval.

Solution:-
# Draw bootstrap replicates of the mean no-hitter time (equal to tau): bs_replicates
bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(nohitter_times, np.mean,10000)

# Compute the 95% confidence interval: conf_int
conf_int = np.percentile(bs_replicates,[2.5,97.5])

# Print the confidence interval
print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'games')

# Plot the histogram of the replicates
_ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel(r'$\tau$ (games)')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')

# Show the plot
plt.show()

Q6:-
Define a function with call signature draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1) to perform pairs bootstrap estimates on linear regression parameters.
Use np.arange() to set up an array of indices going from 0 to len(x). These are what you will resample and use them to pick values out of the x and y arrays.
Use np.empty() to initialize the slope and intercept replicate arrays to be of size size.
Write a for loop to:
Resample the indices inds. Use np.random.choice() to do this.
Make new x and y arrays bs_x and bs_y using the the resampled indices bs_inds. To do this, slice x and y with bs_inds.
Use np.polyfit() on the new x and y arrays and store the computed slope and intercept.
Return the pair bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept.

Solution:-
def draw_bs_pairs_linreg(x, y, size=1):
    """Perform pairs bootstrap for linear regression."""

    # Set up array of indices to sample from: inds
    inds = np.arange(len(x))

    # Initialize replicates: bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps
    bs_slope_reps = np.empty(size)
    bs_intercept_reps = np.empty(size)

    # Generate replicates
    for i in range(size):
        bs_inds = np.random.choice(inds, size=len(inds))
        bs_x, bs_y = x[bs_inds], y[bs_inds]
        bs_slope_reps[i], bs_intercept_reps[i] = np.polyfit(bs_x,bs_y,1)

    return bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps

Q7:-
Use your draw_bs_pairs_linreg() function to take 1000 bootstrap replicates of the slope and intercept. The x-axis data is illiteracy and y-axis data is fertility.
Compute and print the 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the slope.
Plot and show a histogram of the slope replicates. Be sure to label your axes. This has been done for you, so click 'Submit Answer' to see your histogram!

Solution:-
# Generate replicates of slope and intercept using pairs bootstrap
bs_slope_reps, bs_intercept_reps = draw_bs_pairs_linreg(illiteracy,fertility,1000)

# Compute and print 95% CI for slope
print(np.percentile(bs_slope_reps, [2.5, 97.5]))

# Plot the histogram
_ = plt.hist(bs_slope_reps, bins=50, normed=True)
_ = plt.xlabel('slope')
_ = plt.ylabel('PDF')
plt.show()

Q8:-
Generate an array of x-values consisting of 0 and 100 for the plot of the regression lines. Use the np.array() function for this.
Write a for loop in which you plot a regression line with a slope and intercept given by the pairs bootstrap replicates. Do this for 100 lines.
When plotting the regression lines in each iteration of the for loop, recall the regression equation y = a*x + b. Here, a is bs_slope_reps[i] and b is bs_intercept_reps[i].
Specify the keyword arguments linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.2, and color='red' in your call to plt.plot().
Make a scatter plot with illiteracy on the x-axis and fertility on the y-axis. Remember to specify the marker='.' and linestyle='none' keyword arguments.
Label the axes, set a 2% margin, and show the plot. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to visualize the bootstrap regressions!

Solution:-
# Generate array of x-values for bootstrap lines: x
x = np.array([0,100])

# Plot the bootstrap lines
for i in range(100):
    _ = plt.plot(x,bs_slope_reps[i]*x
                 + bs_intercept_reps[i],
                 linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.2, color='red')

# Plot the data
_ = plt.plot(illiteracy,fertility,marker='.',linestyle='none')

# Label axes, set the margins, and show the plot
_ = plt.xlabel('illiteracy')
_ = plt.ylabel('fertility')
plt.margins(0.02)
plt.show()
